# wa0rc-web

Website for the Waypoint Amateur Radio Club (WA0RC) in Olathe, Kansas.

## Overview

A simple static site providing club officer information, VE testing details,
and contact info. Deployed to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)
using Wrangler.

## Structure

```text
index.html                   - Club website (single-page)
events-upcoming.yml          - Upcoming club events data
events-past.yml              - Past club events data
wrangler.jsonc               - Cloudflare Pages / Wrangler configuration
.assetsignore                - Files excluded from Cloudflare Pages deployment
.github/workflows/           - GitHub Actions CI/CD
.github/schemas/events.json  - JSON Schema for event YAML validation
.github/scripts/             - Automation scripts
```

## Updating Events

Club events are managed in two YAML files: `events-upcoming.yml` and `events-past.yml`.

### Event Format

```yaml
events:
  - name: "ARRL Field Day"
    date: "2026-06-27"              # required, YYYY-MM-DD
    end_date: "2026-06-28"          # optional, for multi-day events
    url: "https://www.arrl.org/field-day"  # optional, makes name a clickable link
    location: "Olathe Prairie Center"      # optional, shown below event name
```

### Adding or Editing Events

1. Edit `events-upcoming.yml` to add or modify upcoming events.
2. Open a pull request with your changes (see [Contributing](#contributing) below).
3. When the PR is opened, a GitHub Actions workflow automatically:
   - Validates the YAML against the schema (catches typos and formatting errors)
   - Runs the update script to inject event HTML into `index.html`
   - Commits the result back to your PR branch
   - Triggers a Cloudflare preview deployment so you can review the live result

Past events do not need to be manually moved - the workflow automatically
migrates events from `events-upcoming.yml` to `events-past.yml` once their
date has passed.

### YAML Rules

- `name` and `date` are required; all other fields are optional
- `date` must use `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- `url` must start with `http://` or `https://`
- No extra/misspelled fields are allowed - the schema validator will catch them

## Contributing

2. Create a new branch on your fork for your changes.
3. Make your edits (e.g., update `events-upcoming.yml`).
4. Open a Pull Request from your branch back to `main` in this repo.

## Local Development
